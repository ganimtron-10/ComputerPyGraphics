# ComputerPyGraphics

A Basic implementation of the Pixels in computer screen using numpy arrays to learn basic Computer Graphics Algorithm in Python.

### How to Use:
1. import ComputerPyGraphics
2. create a simple object by defining the quadrant size
3. then use the methods to modify pixel matrix
4. use show method to see the pixel matrix

### How this Works:
We create a simple representation of each aspect of the graphic creation cycle these representations are
pixel (the smallest unit of screen which emits a specific light) - an element in matrix (can contain any thing alphanumerical value assumed as color)
screen (collection of pixel) - a numpy matrix filled with a specific character assumed as the background color
then some basic methods to retrive and update the element at any specific position (coloring pixels or in our case changing element at the pixel coordinate)
